# Burberry-Regional-Sales-Revenue-Intelligence-1999-
This dashboard was built to analyze Burberry's 1999 sales performance across regions, cities, products, and sales personnel. By visualizing monthly revenue trends, mapping regional strength, and spotlighting top performers, the report offers a strategic view of the company’s retail impact. 
Before constructing the visuals, I evaluated the raw data to understand the scope of analysis required. My goals were to:

Uncover regional and city-level revenue disparities.

Identify sales leaders and their revenue contributions.

Track monthly revenue, profit, and unit price movement to understand seasonality or pricing shifts.

Discover which products and shipping zones held strategic value.
I also wanted to design a layout intuitive enough for executives to digest trends quickly and make confident decisions — so visual hierarchy and chart simplicity were part of my planning.
In-Analysis: Key Visual Stories Monthly Revenue, Profit & Unit Price Trend (Line Chart)
This time-series line chart, spanning January to December 1999, showed subtle revenue fluctuations with modest peaks. Profit and unit price metrics tracked closely, suggesting a steady margin strategy throughout the year.
 Revenue by Salesperson (Bar Chart)
Nancy Freehafer topped the charts, followed by Anne Larsen, Andrew Cencini, and Mariya Sergienko.
This visual helps recognize high-performing reps and evaluate contribution spread across the team.
 Revenue by Region (Pie Chart)
North (32.56%) emerged as the top-performing region, followed by East (24.89%), South (21.57%), and West (20.98%).
The fairly even distribution shows broad market penetration — ideal for maintaining presence while evaluating growth potential.
Revenue by City (Bar Chart)
New York ($50.2K) and Portland ($43.7K) led city contributions.
Cities like Miami, Memphis, and Chicago followed at modest levels — which may require localized strategies.
 Map Visualization: Geo Revenue Heatmap
The map provided a visual anchor for city-wise revenue dispersion, making regional strengths and white-spaces immediately obvious.
Product Insights
Top revenue-generating products included:
Almonds, Beer, Boysenberry Spread, Cajun Seasoning, and Chai. Though the product spread was modest, it allowed for identifying popular SKUs per region.
 Ship Address & Product Name Filters
I included slicers like Region, Salesperson, Ship Address, and Product Name to allow for self-guided exploration — giving stakeholders control over their lens of insight.
Observations & Insights
The North region remains a strategic territory, making up nearly one-third of revenue — resource investment here is justified.
Sales rep performance is top-heavy, with a few individuals driving much of the result — ideal for replication training and bonus structures.
Product sales are relatively consistent, but introducing new product types or limited-time offers may refresh stagnant SKUs.
Revenue trends suggest Burberry maintained pricing integrity and avoided drastic seasonal swings — indicative of a stable luxury pricing model.
Recommendations
Leverage High-Earning Reps: Acknowledge top reps like Nancy and Anne with incentives and have them mentor developing team members.
Deepen Regional Promotions: The North and East have proven profitability; more localized events and campaigns there could amplify performance.
City-Level Targeting: Consider growing business in cities like Miami or Memphis through geo-ads, local partnerships, or micro-influencer activations.
SKU Expansion Strategy: Based on current product data, the assortment is narrow. Explore luxury food/beverage pairings or branded gift sets to increase cart size.
Charting Strategy — Why I Chose These Visuals

Line Chart for time-trended financials — great for spotting dips or upward trends in pricing and margin over time.

Slicers  to create an interactive, executive-friendly exploration layer.
Every chart was selected with a stakeholder in mind — balancing clarity, aesthetics, and executive utility.
